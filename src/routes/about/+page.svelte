			Hey! My name is Leon. I'm a computer science enthusiast currently living in Mainz, Germany. In
			my free time I like to code and make music. Here's what this website could mean to you:
		</p>

		<h2>If you are an artist</h2>
		<p>
			and you find one of your artworks fits a piece of music I wrote, send me a message because I
			would love to use it as cover art!
		</p>

		<h2>If you are a game developer or filmmaker</h2>
		<p>and you need music or sound effects for your project, I would gladly be part of the team.</p>

		<h2>If you like this website</h2>
		<p>
			and you are in need of one yourself, I can offer you experience with full-stack web
			development using React, Vue and Svelte (with which this page was created).
		</p>

		<h2>ANYWAY</h2>
		<p>
			<!-- &#x1F60A; is a smiling emoji -->
			thank you so much for spending a minute to look at my work &#x1F60A;
